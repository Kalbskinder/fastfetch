# Ubuntu fastfetch config

My personal fastfetch config styled for Ubuntu

## Setup
```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kalbskinder/fastfetch/main/setup.sh | bash
```

## Recommended Theme
To get the same result as in the image below you will need this theme: \
https://github.com/catppuccin/gnome-terminal \
\
otherwise the colors will look off and you will have to adjust them yourself
